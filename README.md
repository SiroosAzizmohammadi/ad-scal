This module is built as an add-on to [MRST](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/) and provides functionality to simulate SCAL (Special Core Analysis) experiments, namely drainage and imbibition steady-state, unsteady-state, and centrifuge experiments. Using this module:
1. The SCAL experiments are designed before they are performed using forward simulations
2. The relative permeability and capillary pressure saturation functions of the core plugs are calculated from the measured SCAL data using history matching simulations
